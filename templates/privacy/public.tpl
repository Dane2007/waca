Welcome to the Account Creation tool (ACC). We recognize that you are a volunteer or wish to become a volunteer working to contribute towards the world's largest free online encyclopedia. As such, we recognize that there may be some information you'd rather keep private. We value that privacy and wish to assure you that we have taken steps to ensure that by requesting an account here, you are not at risk of exposing your identity on the internet. At the same time, however, in order to properly process your account request, we do need to collect certain information that will allow us to distinguish you from others editing from the same or a nearby location.


<b>Wikimedia Labs Disclaimer</b>

By using this project, you agree that any private information you give to this project may be made publicly available and not be treated as confidential.

By using this project, you agree that the volunteer administrators of this project will have access to any data you submit. This can include your IP address, your username/password combination for accounts created in Labs services, and any other information that you send. The volunteer administrators of this project are bound by the Wikimedia Labs Terms of Use, and are not allowed to share this information or use it in any non-approved way.

Since access to this information is fundamental to the operation of Wikimedia Labs, these terms regarding use of your data expressly override the Wikimedia Foundation's Privacy Policy as it relates to the use and access of your personal information.


<b>What data do we collect, and why?</b>
This system records your IP Address and useragent data. This information may be processed overseas and your data will remain confidential. It is important to note that this information is provided by your internet browser to any website you visit; it is not possible to confirm any specific person's identity with this information. We only use this to prevent abuse of Wikipedia and ACC.
We also require your email address so that we can respond to you with questions and the result of your request.
By submitting an account request at ACC, you agree to provide this information and allow ACC volunteers to view it for the explicit purpose of reviewing your account request on the English Wikipedia.


<b>How is this data stored, and who can see it?</b>
We store this data in a secure database, which is visible only to ACC developers, several of whom are identified to the Wikimedia Foundation, just as Checkusers are required to do. In order to assist with reviewing your block, this information is provided to ACC volunteers as follows:
<ul>
<li>Status update emails are sent through the system, but to prevent abuse and to be able to correlate you emailing us, your email is visible all volunteers. </li>
<li>Your useragent will only be visible to ACC Senior Developers and those reviewing the block that have access to the CheckUser tool on Wikipedia. CheckUsers need to see your useragent to help differentiate you from the person the block is intended for, and UTRS developers need to see this information to ensure the tool is working properly.</li>
<li>Your IP address will be visible to ACC volunteers only while processing your request. After your request is closed or before it is verified, only tool administrators, Senior Developers, and those that have access to the CheckUser tool on Wikipedia have access to it. This is to be able to prevent abuse of the tool and Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
In very limited cases your IP address and useragent may be stored to prevent additional abuse of ACC or Wikipedia.
Your useragent and IP address additionally be visible upon request from an approved member of the Wikimedia Foundation. The use of this is rare. You agree that any data released under this is subject to the Privacy Policy of the Wikimedia Foundation, and this privacy policy is nullified for the released data only.
At no point will your data be provided to a third party for any purpose; furthermore, this information will be removed from our system no more than one week after your appeal is closed. This removal process is automated, so you don't need to worry about anyone forgetting to hit the "delete" button.
Finally, we are not the Wikimedia Foundation. We are a group of volunteers who have made our identities known to the foundation.


<b>What are your rights with regard to this information?</b>
If you wish to see what information has been collected on you by this system, you may email the development team at enwiki-acc-admins@googlegroups.com to request all information associated with your appeal.
If you do not wish for this information to be collected by ACC, you may appeal via your talk page on Wikipedia. Please note that if you appeal on Wikipedia, your IP address and useragent may be examined by any CheckUser, with cause, in accordance with the Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy.
If you have already entered a account request at ACC and wish for your information to be deleted immediately, please email the development team at enwiki-acc-admins@googlegroups.com to have your appeal deleted from the database. Again, please note that this information will be automatically removed one week after your appeal is resolved.
If you have any questions about this policy, please contact the development team at enwiki-acc-admins@googlegroups.com.
