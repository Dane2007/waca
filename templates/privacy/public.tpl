<p>Welcome to the Account Creation tool (ACC). We recognize that you are a volunteer or wish to become a volunteer
    working to contribute towards the world's largest free online encyclopedia. As such, we recognize that there may be
    some information you'd rather keep private. We value that privacy and wish to assure you that we have taken steps to
    ensure that by requesting an account here, you are not at risk of exposing your identity on the internet. At the
    same time, however, in order to properly process your account request, we do need to collect certain information
    that will allow us to distinguish you from others editing from the same or a nearby location.</p>

<h3>Wikimedia Labs Disclaimer</h3>

<p>By using this project, you agree that any private information you give to this project may be made publicly available
    and not be treated as confidential.</p>
<p>By using this project, you agree that the volunteer administrators of this project will have access to any data you
    submit. This can include your IP address, your username/password combination for accounts created in Labs services,
    and any other information that you send. The volunteer administrators of this project are bound by the Wikimedia
    Labs Terms of Use, and are not allowed to share this information or use it in any non-approved way.</p>
<p>Since access to this information is fundamental to the operation of Wikimedia Labs, these terms regarding use of your
    data expressly override the Wikimedia Foundation's Privacy Policy as it relates to the use and access of your
    personal information.</p>

<h3>What data do we collect, and why?</h3>
<p>Because of how browsers work and similar to other major websites, we receive some information automatically 
	when you visit our project. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including 
	unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of 
	your browser, your browser's language preference, the type and version of your device's operating system, in some 
	cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the Wikimedia 
	Sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to the project.</p>
	
	<p>This information may be processed overseas and your data will remain confidential. It is important to note that 
	this information is provided by your internet browser to any website you visit; it is not possible to confirm 
	any specific person's identity with this information. We only use this to prevent abuse of Wikipedia and ACC. We 
	also require your email address so that we can respond to you with questions and the result of your request. By 
	submitting an account request at ACC, you agree to provide this information and allow ACC volunteers to view it
    for the explicit purpose of reviewing your account request on the English Wikipedia.</p>

<h3>How is this data stored, and who can see it?</h3>
<p>We store this data in a secure database, which is visible only to ACC developers, and select information is availible 
	to project members whom have signed the access to nonpublic information policy with the Wikimedia Foundation.
	In order to assist with reviewing your account request, this information is provided to ACC volunteers as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Status update emails are sent through the system, but to prevent abuse and to be able to correlate you emailing
        us, your email is visible all volunteers.</li>
    <li>Your useragent will only be visible to ACC Senior Developers and those reviewing your account request that have 
		access to the CheckUser tool on Wikipedia. CheckUsers need to see your useragent to help differentiate you from 
		the person the block is intended for, and ACC Senior developers need to see this information to ensure the tool 
		is working properly.</li>
    <li>Your IP address will be visible to ACC volunteers only while processing your request. After your request is
        closed or before it is verified, only tool administrators, Senior Developers, and those that have access to the
        CheckUser tool on Wikipedia have access to it. This is to be able to prevent abuse of the tool and Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>In very limited cases your IP address and useragent may be stored to prevent additional abuse of ACC or Wikipedia.
    Your useragent and IP address additionally be visible upon request from an approved member of the Wikimedia
    Foundation. The use of this is rare. You agree that any data released under this is subject to the Privacy Policy of
    the Wikimedia Foundation, and this document is nullified for the released data only.
    At no point will your data be provided to a third party for any purpose; furthermore, this information will be
    removed from our system no more than sixteen days after your request is closed. This removal process is automated, 
	so you don't need to worry about anyone forgetting to hit the "delete" button.
    Finally, we are not the Wikimedia Foundation. We are a group of volunteers who have made our identities known to the
    foundation.</p>

<h3>What are your rights with regard to this information?</h3>
<p>If you wish to see what information has been collected on you by this system, you may email the senior development team at
    enwiki-acc-admins@googlegroups.com to request all information associated with your account request.
    If you do not wish for this information to be collected by ACC, you may request an account through the regular account creation
	interface for Wikimedia projects.
    Please note that if you appeal on Wikipedia, your IP address and useragent may be examined by any CheckUser, with
    cause, in accordance with the Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy.
    If you have already entered an account request at ACC and wish for your information to be deleted immediately, please
    email the development team at enwiki-acc-admins@googlegroups.com to have your appeal deleted from the database.
    Again, please note that this information will be automatically removed sixteen days after your appeal is resolved.
