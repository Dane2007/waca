acc.php:
1. Interface needs formatted better
2. More of the interface should be configurable
3. Requests with multiple tries in history should be stripped of links (forcing the user to zoom and examine the circumstances
4. Mail the interface user when thier account has changed status (i.e. promoted, suspended, etc), and whom changed the status
5. Add comments to zoom, probably require a new table.

accounts2.php:
1. Access control for !die
2. Some sort of stats mechanism. Maybe just telling the user where they rank upon !count
