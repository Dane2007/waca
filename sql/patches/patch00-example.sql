-- This is an example patch file.

-- Patches should be applied in numeric order, and should contain SQL statements to
-- be run on the database.

-- This file will also be run, so the build scripts get something to test with, but
-- this file doesn't contain any useful SQL statements to run in, so will do 
-- nothing.

-- Leave this file here, or you'll break the database build script.
